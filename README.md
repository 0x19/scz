This is demo app that I prepared for internal workshop at cngroup.dk
More information and workshop video here https://www.graph.cool/forum/t/next-js-react-graphql-presentation-and-demo/90

to run it:

1. `git clone https://github.com/alexedev/scz.git myfolder`
2. `cd myfolder && npm i`
3. `npm run dev`
4. open http://localhost: 3000

adding Faculties works but they are not attached to unversities for now
 - this is why they are not shown in the lists. I will update README after fix.
